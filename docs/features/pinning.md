# Pinning

#### Pinning

Similarly to role granting,
we handle adding a 📌 (`:pushpin:`) reaction in a way that we count the number of members (some members, such as teachers, has bigger weight)
and if it reaches the specified threshold,
the bot pins the message so other people can see it in the future.
